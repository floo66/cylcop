abstract = {The second edition of this book widens the scope of the methods and applications of Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis. We have introduced more up to date data sets in our examples. These give the text a higher degree of timeliness and add an even more applied flavour. Since multivariate statistical methods are heavily used in quantitative finance and risk management we have put more weight on the presentation of distributions and their densities. We discuss in detail different families of heavy tailed distributions (Laplace, Generalized Hy- perbolic). We also devoted a section on copulae, a new concept of dependency used in the financial risk management and credit scoring. In the chapter on computer intensive meth- ods we have added support vector machines, a new classification technique from statistical learning theory. We apply this method to bankruptcy and rating analysis of firms. The very important CART (Classification and Regression Tree) technique is also now inserted into this chapter. We give an application to rating of companies. The probably most important step towards readability and user friendliness of this book is that we have translated all Quantlets into the R and Matlab language. The algorithms can be downloaded from the authors' web sites. In the preparation of this 2nd edition, we received helpful output from Anton Andriyashin, Ying Chen, Song Song and Uwe Ziegenhagen.

	abstract = {Animal movement is often modeled in discrete time, formulated in terms of steps taken between successive locations at regular time intervals. Steps are characterized by the distance between successive locations (step-lengths) and changes in direction (turn angles). Animals commonly exhibit a mix of directed movements with large step lengths and turn angles near 0 when traveling between habitat patches and more wandering movements with small step lengths and uniform turn angles when foraging. Thus, step-lengths and turn angles will typically be cross-correlated.Most models of animal movement assume that step-lengths and turn angles are independent, likely due to a lack of available alternatives. Here, we show how the method of copulae can be used to fit multivariate distributions that allow for correlated step lengths and turn angles.We describe several newly developed copulae appropriate for modeling animal movement data and fit these distributions to data collected on fishers (Pekania pennanti). The copulae are able to capture the inherent correlation in the data and provide a better fit than a model that assumes independence. Further, we demonstrate via simulation that this correlation can impact movement patterns (e.g. rates of dispersion overtime).We see many opportunities to extend this framework (e.g. to consider autocorrelation in step attributes) and to integrate it into existing frameworks for modeling animal movement and habitat selection. For example, copula could be used to more accurately sample available locations when conducting habitat-selection analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Mutual information (MI) is a basic concept in information theory. Therefore, estimates of the MI are fundamentally important in most information theory applications. This paper provides a new way of understanding and estimating the MI using the copula function. First, the entropy of the copula, named the copula entropy, is defined as a measure of the dependence uncertainty represented by the copula function and then the MI is shown to be equivalent to the negative copula entropy. With this equivalence, the MI can be estimated by first estimating the empirical copula and then estimating the entropy of the empirical copula. Thus, the MI estimate is an estimation of the entropy, which reduces the complexity and computational requirements. Tests show that the method is more effective than the traditional method.}
