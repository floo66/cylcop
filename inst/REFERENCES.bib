@article{Solow1988,
abstract = {Two statistical tests for correlation between a circular variate and a linear variate are presented. The tests are applied to a small data set concerning Freon-12 concentration and wind direction in Woods Hole, Massachusetts during the summer of 1987. A significant correlation is found. Further analysis suggests that this directional effect is related to onshore Freon-12 release.},

abstract = {A simulation study of the parametric and nonparametric Linear-Circular Correlation Coefficient was carried out to evaluate the mathematical distribution the statistics followed. A further study was conducted to investigate the effect of ties on the nonparametric correlation coefficient. Lastly, a com-parison of power between the parametric and nonparametric Linear-Circular Correlation coefficient was conducted with varying sample sizes, means, and distributions.},
