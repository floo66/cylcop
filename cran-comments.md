## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* written TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.
* made sure all .Rd files have a \value section.
* uncommented code in examples and used \donttest instead.
* removed options(warn=-1) in function cop_plot().

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.2.1
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.5
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
